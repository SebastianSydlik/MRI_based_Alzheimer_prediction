# MRI based dementia prediction
This repository uses the kaggle dataset "MRI and Alzheimer" from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/mri-and-alzheimers/data. 
This is my capstone project of the MachineLearningOperations course "MLOps Zoomcamp" from DataTalksClubs (https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp). 

Early diagnosis of dementia, of which Alzheimer is one specific form, is crucial as irreversible damage already occurs before the onset of symptoms. The data used in this repository are collected with Magnet Resonance Imaging (MRI), which allows imaging inner body structures, such as the brain. The measured parameters are then correlated with clinical tests for dementia for demented and non-demented individuals. Based on this data I use machine learning to be able to predict the probability of dementia based solely on MRI scans, to predict individuals with high-risk of dementia before the onset of symptoms and hence a potential treatment in an early phase of the disease.
